ROADMAP
=======

* 0.7.0

- bindings for the "low-level" bzip2 (de)compression API

   http://www.bzip.org/1.0.5/bzip2-manual-1.0.5.html#low-level

   That API would enable to (de)compress in memory, without forcibly
   having to (de)compress all the data at once (as currently supported
   by Bz2.{un,}compress). Low-level API bindings are a must for
   integration into Batteries (http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org).

* 0.6.0

- feature complete wrt the latest "GZ" release
   (of course excluding zlib bindings, which have been removed)
